The code demonstrates thread synchronization using Semaphore to prevent data corruption. It effectively uses multiple threads to improve performance for computationally intensive tasks. Threads access shared lists of numbers and primeNumbers. The Semaphore object controls access to these lists. A thread calls WaitOne() to obtain a permission from Semaphore before accessing a shared list. When allowed, the thread can process items in the list. After the job is completed, the thread releases the permission using the Release() function. This allows other threads to access the shared list.
